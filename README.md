<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="workflow automation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1413e195-0cfd-4344-8d26-3763d44b835b" />

## What it does
This automation project connects `Google Forms`, `Asana`, and `Slack` using `Zapier`. 
The goal is simple:
1. Someone submits a form
2. A task is created in Asana
3. A message is sent in Slack

It helps teams collect structured input, take action fast, and stay updated without lifting a fingure

## Tools Used
`Google Forms` – to collect requests or information from users
`Asana` – to turn those submissions into actionable tasks
`Slack` – to alert the team instantly when a form is submitted
`Zapier` – to connect them without writing any code

## When might you need this project?
This project can be useful in many ways such as:
- Project managers collecting bug reports or feature ideas
- HR teams collecting job applications or employee requests
- Admin teams automating task creation from field teams

No manual copy-pasting between apps!

## The simple workflow
A user submits a **Google Form** to request a feature update for an app.
**Zapier** triggers a new task in an **Asana** project with the form details submitted by the user.
Another **Zapier** step sends a **Slack** message to a specific team channel (say, a channel for product managers)

All this happening with seconds with no human effort.

## Example Use Case
Imagine you're a product team lead. You want to:
- Collect feature ideas from internal teams
- Track those ideas in Asana
- Notify your team when new ideas come in
With this setup:
- Everyone fills the same Google Form
- You get clean, structured tasks in Asana
- Your team is alerted via Slack instantly

## What I Learned
- How to build useful automations without writing code
- Using Zapier’s multi-step workflows
- Mapping dynamic form data into Asana and Slack
- Real-world business use cases for no-code tools

The simple workflow

![2. Google Form Submission](<Images/2. Google Form Submission.png>)

A user(Jonathan) submits a Google form to request a feature update

![3. Asana Task Assignment](<Images/3. asana task assignment.png>)

The user's request is sent as a new task with the user's name and the requested feature as the name of the task.

At the same time, the slack channel of the product managers is also updated with the user's request details.
